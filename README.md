# HWK1-refactoring-code

This project is to refactor code for an existing site to make it more accessible. My job was to copy the starter code to my own repository and add details so that I can improve the code. For example, the images previously in index.html were missing alt attributes, which have now been added.

## Installation:

A repository was created on GitHub and cloned to my local folder

The deployed website linked below was done using the GitHub by changing my source to main.


## Changes Added
 
* Changed the title from Website to a more descriptive title that explains what the website is about
* Adding Semantic HTML elements, nav, main, section, article into the websites starter code
* Adding descriptive information about the images using the alt attribute.
* Changing the heading tags to be more specific.
* Adding multiple descriptive commit messages on GitHub using git add, git commit and git push.
